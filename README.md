## Requirements

Use the package manager [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to install required Python dependencies. Note: We used Python 3.7.

```bash
conda env create -f enviroment.yml
```

## Training

The following command will train and predict for all regions from epidemic week 202036 (GPU):

```bash
python -u main.py -st MA -j -d 0 1 2 3 -ew 202036 --seed 1234 -m GradABM-time-varying -di COVID
```

where `-st` is the US state (joint model for counties in the state ), `-j` is joint training, `-d` are the GPU devices to be used, `-ew` is the [epidemic week](https://epiweeks.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and `di` is disease (either COVID or Flu).
For running this in multiple weeks, see examples in ```Scripts/run.sh```.

For CPU, you want to use:
```bash
python -u main.py -st MA -j -d cpu -ew 202036 --seed 1234 -m GradABM-time-varying -di COVID
```
